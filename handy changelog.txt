- Europe + USA 1939 is set to "quick speed", 1 turn = 1 month and faster construction, quick speed is adjusted to be even more quick for constructing stuff
- 5 hp healed per turn -> 15, resource stockpiles are pretty useful now
- Territority capture is now 3x3, encirclements become slightly easier and beelining off of a railroad is real effective now
- Newly constructed units start at 1/2 hp, stockpile those resources carefully!
- Arsenal/military barracks can't be rushed with gold anymore, consider building defenses ahead of time
- Battleships do substantially more damage to cities, making naval landings pretty easy as long as you have them
- Submarines can no longer move after attacking
- Unit bleeding when out of supply -2 -> -10 a turn
- "Open city" effect is removed when the city is captured; this mainly applies to Germany's ability to more easily defend France once it conquers it
- Factories are no longer restricted; you can build all of them in one city
- Turn order is changed for allies/soviets to go first then the axis; this gives axis a slight edge as "out of supply" check is performed at the end of everyone's turns
